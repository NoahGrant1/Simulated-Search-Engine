Recall 
how 
the 
arithmetic 
operator / 
works. 
If 
both 
operands 
of / 
are 
integers, 
the 
result
is 
an 
integer; 
otherwise, 
the 
result 
is 
a 
floating-point 
number. 
Similarly, 
the stream
insertion 
operator, <<, 
and 
the 
stream 
extraction 
operator, >>, 
are 
overloaded. 
The
operator << 
is 
used 
as 
both 
a 
stream 
insertion 
operator 
and 
a 
left 
shift 
operator. 
The
operator >> 
is 
used 
as 
both 
a 
stream 
extraction 
operator 
and 
a 
right 
shift 
operator. 
These
are 
examples 
of 
operator 
overloading.
Other 
examples 
of 
overloaded 
operators 
are + 
and -. 
The 
results 
of + 
and – 
are 
different
for 
integer 
arithmetic,
